			<h2>What the heck is it?</h2>
			<p>
				HTML5 Canvas Piano, is a "fully" functional piano created entirely in the browser using  &lt;canvas /&gt;
				and &lt;audio/&gt; It can play and visualize single notes but you can also choose to play chords by selecting one
				from the dropdown at the top right of this page. These chords will then be played by composing them from single 
				notes.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can only control the first 2 octaves, the other two are purely visual.
			</p>
			<h2>Is it reliable?</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>NO</strong>, especially in this first version some notes might be dropped from chords when you attempt
				to play them.
			</p>
			<h2>Why was it then developped?</h2>
			<p>
				Mostly as a fun weekend project, to get more familiar with HTML5 goodness. 
				This is actually a port of <a href="http://www.mirc.net/projects.php?go=1140115468">Rhodes Piano for mIRC</a>
				which I made 5 years ago in reaction to negative sounds in the mIRC scripting scene saying "everything has been done already" .  The &lt;canvas /&gt; works in a very similar way as <a href="http://www.zigwap.com/mirc/pic_window.php">picture windows</a> do in mIRC Script thus the idea of porting was born.
			</p>
			<h2>Roadblock</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Investigate why notes are sometimes lost.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you have cool idea's please mention them on the github issues page.
